This project consists of building a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 

I expect to use HTML elements that I learned in the previous chapters such as: anchor tags, img tags, h and p tags as well as some attributes such as: href and src to tell the browser the a and img elements' destinations.

This will consist of vanilla HTML. Later on in TOP course this will be revisited to introduce styling using CSS.
